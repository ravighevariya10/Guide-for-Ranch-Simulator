    <p style="text-align: justify;">For best results with early game money-making, head to that southern corner of the map and drive between the road and the railroad tracks, looking into the woods on both sides for the bears. Typically I can get two bears before I need to either head home for the day or find a bus stop to save and reload to make more spawn. I have had up to four bears in that area however. For best results, buy coolers as soon as possible so that you can haul all your meat back efficiently. That got me most of my money until I got my barn and pigs up and running. As always, be sure to sell them at the burger place and if you can, hold onto them until there&apos;s a special for wild meat.</p>
